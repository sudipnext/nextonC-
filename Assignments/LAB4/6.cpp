// Create a class with a data member to hold a "serial number" for each object created from the class. 
// That is, the first object created will be numbered 1, the second 2, and so on by using the basic 
// concept of static data members. Use static member function if it is useful in the program. 
// Otherwise, make a separate program that demonstrates the use of static member function.
